# GalacticScreeningConditions

This repository produces the figures contained within [our paper on galactic (scalar-tensor) screening conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19955). 

% Specifically, we numerically solve the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and symmetron model equations of motion to derive the full scalar field. We then perform analysis on these field profiles to determine the regions that are considered.
