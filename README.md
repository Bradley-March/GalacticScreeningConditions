# GalacticScreeningConditions

This repository produces the figures contained within [our paper on galactic (scalar-tensor) screening conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19955). 

## Usage

The code to create the figures is contained within ScreeningPaperFigs.py.

The solutions required to run this file can be made available upon request (email: [bradley.march@nottingham.ac.uk](bradley.march@nottingham.ac.uk)), or can be produced by running run_solutions.py (_note: this will take considerable time_).
