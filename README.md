# GalacticScreeningConditions

This repository produces the figures contained within [our paper on galactic (scalar-tensor) screening conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19955). 

## Usage

The code to create the figures is contained within ```ScreeningPaperFigs.py.```

The solutions required to run this file can be made available upon request (email: bradley.march@nottingham.ac.uk), or can be produced by running run_solutions.py (_note: this will take considerable time _).

The scalar-tensor models we use are described in section 2.3 ($f(R)$) and 2.4 (symmetron) of the paper.
We solve the scalar fields of these models using the methods highlighted in section 3.2 (Solvers/symm.

Our galactic model (Packages/galaxy_relations.py) is described in section 3.1, with an overview of the pipeline to
